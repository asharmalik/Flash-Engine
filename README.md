Flash-Engine
============

This was a tool I wrote in middle school to help me find and edit variables in flash games.
It uses enumeration to discover every variable declared in a flash file.

Usage
============
- Load Flash Engine.swf over a flash game/file
- Click "Find All Variables" to discover all variables
- Add to cheat table or set directly through UI
